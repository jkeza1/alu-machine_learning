def sensitivity(confusion):
    """
    Function that calculates the sensitivity for each class in
    a confusion matrix
    Arguments:
        - confusion is a confusion numpy.ndarray of shape (classes, classes)
            where row indices represent the correct labels and column indices
            represent the predicted labels
            * classes is the number of classes
    Returns:
        A numpy.ndarray of shape (classes,) containing the sensitivity
        of each class

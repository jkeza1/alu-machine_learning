    Determines if gradient descent should stop early based on validation cost.

    Args:
        cost (float): Current validation cost of the neural network.
        opt_cost (float): Lowest recorded validation cost of
        the neural network.
        threshold (float): Threshold used for early stopping.
        patience (int): Patience count used for early stopping.
        count (int): Count of how long the threshold has not been met.

    Returns:
        bool: Whether to stop gradient descent early.
        int: Updated count of how long the threshold has not been met.

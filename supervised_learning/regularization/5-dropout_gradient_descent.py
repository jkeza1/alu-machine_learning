    Updates the weights of a neural network with Dropout regularization

    Parameters:
    Y -- numpy.ndarray of shape (classes, m) with correct labels for the data
    weights -- dictionary of the weights and biases of the neural network
    cache -- dictionary of the outputs and dropout masks of
    each layer of the neural network
    alpha -- learning rate
